* Tile maps returns pointers in chunklist
    -Dereference pointers before passing to the renderer
* Tile map using int32_t for IDs instead of strings
    -addTileDefinition and setTile must be used with int32_t
* Colors reworked to work with bytes instead of float
    - .r() and .setR() work with uint32_t now. for floats, use
	.rAsFloat()/.setRAsFloat()
* Removed util namespace
    -Omit /util/ from includes and ::util from accesses.
* JsonCpp used for json loading instead of json0
