     *  @class AudioEffect
     *  @brief Base class for EFX based effects
     *
     *  Effects can be added to slots in the AudioPlayer class. When an audio source sends audio to the effect slot an effect has been added to, the effect is applied.
     *
     *  All the effects are based directly on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzhang.su%2Fseal%2FEffectsExtensionGuide.pdf">EFX specification</a> and are hence not documented here. So have a look there to find out all about what the effects are, and what default values they have and which values they expect.

     *  @return The id.
     ***
     *  @fn void AudioEffect::setEffectGain(float gain)
     *  @brief Set the gain of the effect.
     *
     *  Setting this will cause a change in the output volume of the effect applied on sources that send to it. The default is 1.0f and the total output will be capped at 1.0f. 
     *  Assert/undefined behavior if the input is less than zero.
     *  @param gain Gain.

     *  @fn float AudioEffect::getEffectGain() const
     *  @brief Get the gain of the effect.
     *  @return The gain.
     ***
     *  @fn void AudioEffect::setAutoAdjustments(bool enabled)
     *  @brief Set auto adjustments.
     *
     *  This property is used to enable or disable automatic send adjustments based on the physical positions of the sources and the listener. 
     *  It should be enabled when an application wishes to use a reverb effect to simulate the environment surrounding a listener or a collection of Sources. Default is to be on.
     *  @param enabled True if it should be on.
     ***
     *  @fn bool AudioEffect::getAutoAdjustments() const
     *  @brief Check if auto adjustments are on.
     *  @return True if it is on.
