     ***
     *  @class AudioPlayer
     *  @brief Plays audio sources.
     *
     *  Using the audio player, sampled audio and audio streams can be played. Upon playing, a handle to the playing audio will be given and this can be used to change properties of the audio in real time if desired. 
     *
     *  There is a limit on how many sounds can be played at once which can be accessed with getMaxSoundsPlaying. When more sounds than this is played, nothing will happen. The getNumSoundsPlaying function can be used to check how many sounds are currently being played.
     *
     *  The AudioPlayer always has a Listener. The listener can be thought of as the "ear" in the audio scene. The position and orientation of the listener will affect how the sounds are positioned in the speakers when being played.
     *  
     *  Furthermore, effects and filters such as reverb, echo, distiortion and a handful of other ones can be added to the player's effect slots to enable richer audio environments.

     *  @brief Stop an audio.
     *
     *  Stopping an audio terminates its playing completely and the handle will be invalidated. Hence playback cannot be resumed but the audio has to be played again using the play function.

     *  @brief Set the attenuation factor of a sound that is being played.
     *
     *  The attenuation factor is a multiplier which affects how fast the sound fades over distance. A higher number means that it becomes quiet faster. 1.0f is the default. By setting the value to zero, the sound is heard at an infinite distance.
