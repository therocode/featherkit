     *  @class AudioFilter
     *  @brief Base class for EFX based filters
     *
     *  Filters can be added to slots in the AudioPlayer class and directly on audio sources. A filter affects the frquencies of the audio in various frequency ranges.
     *
     *  All the filters are based directly on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzhang.su%2Fseal%2FFiltersExtensionGuide.pdf">EFX specification</a> and are hence not documented here. So have a look there to find out all about what the filters are, and what default values they have and which values they expect.
